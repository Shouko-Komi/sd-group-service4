    </header>
    <section>
        <p>As a consumer, you have the **right to reconsider** certain purchases or contracts, thanks to the **cooling-off period**. This legal protection allows you to **cancel a contract within a specified time frame** without penalties. At <a href="https://sdgroupofcompanies.com.au/" target="_blank">SD Group of Companies</a>, we educate consumers about their rights so they can make informed financial and business decisions.</p>

        <h2>What is a Cooling-off Period?</h2>
        <p>The cooling-off period is a **legal timeframe** in which consumers can withdraw from agreements such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real estate purchases</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Car and loan agreements</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Insurance policies</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Membership subscriptions</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Long is the Cooling-off Period?</h2>
        <p>Depending on the contract type and state laws, the cooling-off period **varies**. Some typical timeframes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Property transactions:</strong> 3 to 5 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Car purchases:</strong> 1 to 2 business days</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance policies:</strong> 14 to 30 days</li>
        </ul>
